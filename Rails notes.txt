Resources creates all possible CRUD routes for you, when you define them in the routes files.
So, if you do a `resources :tweeets` in routes file, it creates the following routes for you:

Prefix        Method   Route                              Controller#action
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    tweeets   GET      /tweeets(.:format)                 tweeets#index
              POST     /tweeets(.:format)                 tweeets#create
 new_tweeet   GET      /tweeets/new(.:format)             tweeets#new
edit_tweeet   GET      /tweeets/:id/edit(.:format)        tweeets#edit
     tweeet   GET      /tweeets/:id(.:format)             tweeets#show
              PATCH    /tweeets/:id(.:format)             tweeets#update
              PUT      /tweeets/:id(.:format)             tweeets#update
              DELETE   /tweeets/:id(.:format)             tweeets#destroy

When we have a look at the routes we get to know which action will be fired on what route.
The routes need to have identical names for actions and view files, unless specified otherwise.

Also, you can have before and after action after a particular action is performed. So, it's basically a callback before/after something has happened in a particular action.
The difference between a `new` and `create` route is that the new route creates a blank object which can then be utiltised inside a form, but the create action actually creates a new entry/record in the db. We have a similar setup in edit/update flow edits pulls out the data/object from db and update actually updates an entry from the db.
We put up our associations in Model files. We put associations in both the files they are associated in which means we may have one-to-one relationship, we need to specify it in both the files which have this association. Also we need to establish that relation in DB via a migration.

Any variable defined with `@` in the beginning is automatically available in the view files, such variables are called instance variables. Instance variables defined within an action are available even in the partials used inside the view file for that action. We don't need to explicitly pass local variables for each partial. Instance variables are available in it. If a partial explicitly needs local variables, then we can have it as well.
You can have multiple instance variables passed to the same view file. But it is a convention to pass only one wrapped inside a PORO.
You need to get acquainted with the methods provided by Rails, such as redirect_to, link_to, form_for, etc. It's used in controllers and views extensively.

Steps to navigate through Rails:
Even before you start working on actual code, just have a check that you need to compulsorily have a controller, a route, a model and a view to work with.
Look at what action is fired at the route, what model it deals with.
Check for before action, after action callbacks.
Check for what associations it has with the specific model.
Whenever we are trying to access a partial it starts off from a relative path or directly the root path.
Apply validations for whatever you are doing in Rails, apply on model & on DB level as well.

The devise gem generates the model and views for use all by itself, it's very simple to integrate user authentication with that gem.

Associations:
Whenever we add associations in the model files each model has now got it's own symbol which is accessible in other models files as another symbol. So, if we want to access User model inside Tweeet Model, we can add that association with the help of symbols like this:
```
class Tweeet < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```
Here the `user` symbol indicates the User model. Similarly the Tweeet model will be accessible in the User model like this:
```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :tweeets
end
```
So, here we have established a one-to-many relationship like. One user has many tweeets and, conversely when we say one tweeet belongs to one user, we have established one-to-one relationship here.
